               <p>
                 We spoke with Farouk and then met with him at our home. He spent hours answering our questions, providing objective data regarding how many homes they sell, how long their listings 
                 typically stay on the market, and providing tons of info on comps in the area. Farouk made the process incredibly easy and took extra steps many other Realtors don't (but should), like having a pro come and 
                 give us staging tips, having professional photographs taken, and a lot more - Sarah <br> <br>

                 I have had the experience of making a couple different home purchases during the course of my adult life. I just discovered the necessity and desire to buy a bigger home as my family started to expand. Before findingÂ  Farouk, I spoke with a number of different
             realtors who showed me a range of properties. I wanted to collaborate with someone I could trust when making a decision of this magnitude - Wayne
