This captivating game revolves around the challenge of guessing a number, with JavaScript handling key functionalities. Players input their guesses, and the game checks if the guess is correct, displaying a corresponding message. Also, a scoring mechanism that deducts points with each incorrect guess. Additionally, there's a high-score feature that keeps track of the player's best score within a session, visible via a dedicated button. Players can reset the game to start anew, making this project both entertaining and educational.

          <b>Outcome:</b>
This engaging game involves two players taking turns to roll a virtual dice. The game incorporates JavaScript to handle essential functionalities such as rolling the dice, tracking and holding the current score, and switching to the next player when a player rolls a 1. Additionally, the game features a reset function to start the entire game afresh. This project was a thrilling solo endeavor that honed my skills in web development and allowed me to create an enjoyable and functional game.

          <b>Outcome:</b>
        In my first-year college HTML and CSS course, I undertook a real estate assignment that involved designing a static website for a fictional real estate company. The project included creating a home page, active listings page, contact page, and sitemap, all accessible through a navigation bar. I used grid layout to structure the pages. While the pages were static and not responsive, the assignment allowed me to gain valuable experience in HTML and CSS and develop a real estate website with a structured layout.
